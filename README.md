# Welcome!

I’m Antonio Magherini, a MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

Apart from hydraulic and particularly river engineering topics, during my studies in Delft I'm learning many interesting aspects of modelling, programming, and above all the broad field of machine learning and deep learning (artificial intelligence in general). 

My main interests are river morphodynamics and interventions, river modelling, flood risk and natural hazards mitigation as well as hydrology and in general hydraulic engineering topics.

From July 2023 to April 2024 I was teaching assistant at the Faculty of [Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg) for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, that aims to provide the students with the necessary tools for civil engineering and earth sciences applications.

Since February 2024 I'm also student assistant for the project STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering And Management Simulation, whose goal is to develop a serious game for simulating stakeholder participation during river engineering decision-making processes.

I'm currently doing an internship at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) for working on my Master thesis, which focuses on developing a deep-learning model for predicting the morphological changes of rivers.

During my second year of the Master I performed some laboratory experiments on the accumulation of plastic particles upstream of hydraulic structures at the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory of TU Delft. I had the opportunity to publish and present an abstract of this experience at [NCR DASY 2024](https://ncr-web.org/). If you are interested, you can read [my abstract](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/accumulation-of-floating-particles-at-hydraulic-structures) and [the full book of abstracts](https://kbase.ncr-web.org/outputs/ncr-days-2024-book-of-abstracts/).
