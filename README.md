- WElcome to my GitHub account, I’m Antonio Magherini.
- I'm a MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic track at TU Delft, in the Netherlands.
- Here at TUD I'm learning many interesting things related to coding, modelling, machine learning 
- apart from hydraulic and particularly river engineering. 
- I still don't know what to do after my graduation, but I'm considering either to do a PhD or to work in a company.
