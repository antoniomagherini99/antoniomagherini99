## Welcome!

I’m Antonio Magherini, a MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

Apart from hydraulic and particularly river engineering topics, during my studies at TUD I'm learning many interesting things related to modelling, programming, and the broad field of artificial intelligence. 

My main interests are river morphology, river modelling, flood risk modelling, assessment and mitigation as well as hydrology and in general hydrogeological risk.

Since July 2023 I am teaching assistant at the Faculty of [Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg) for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers, that aims at providing the students with the necessary tools for civil engineering and earth sciences applications.

Since February 2024 I'm also student assistant for the project STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering And Management Simulation, whose goal is to develop a serious game for simulating stakeholder participation during river engineering decision-making processes.

I'm currently doing an internship at [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) for working on my Master thesis, which focuses on implementing a deep-learning model for predicting the morphological chenges of a sand-bed braided river.
