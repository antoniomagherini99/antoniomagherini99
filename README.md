- I’m Antonio Magherini, welcome to my GitHub account!
- I'm a MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic track at TU Delft, in the Netherlands.
- Here at TUD I'm learning many interesting things related to coding, modelling, and machine learning 
  apart from hydraulic and particularly river engineering topics. 
- My main interests are river morphology, river modelling, flood risk assessment and mitigation as well as hydrology and in a broader sense hydrogeological risk. 
- I still don't know what's the plan after the graduation, but I'm considering either to do a PhD or to work in a company.
