## Welcome!
I’m Antonio Magherini, a MSc student of Civil Engineering - Hydraulic track at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), in the Netherlands.

Apart from hydraulic and particularly river engineering topics, during my studies at TUD I'm learning\
many interesting things related to modelling, programming, and machine and deep learning. 

My main interests are river morphology, river modelling, flood risk modelling, assessment and mitigation\
as well as hydrology and in a broader sense hydrogeological risk.

Since July 2023 I am teaching assistant at the Faculty of [Civil Engineering and Geosciences](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg)\
for the common module MUDE - Modelling, Uncertainty and Data for Engineers.

Since February 2024 I'm also student assistant for STREAMS - Stakeholder Training in River Engineering\
And Management Simulation, a project which aims at developing a serious game for simulating stakeholder\
participation during river engineering decision-making processes.

I'm currently doing an internship in [Deltares](https://www.deltares.nl/) for working on my Master thesis, which focuses\
on implementing a deep-learning model for predicting the morphological chenges of a sand-bed braided river.
